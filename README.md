Here is a little side project of mine,

About a month ago I set out to write an entire game of chess in C without using any external libraries (using purely stdio.h).
Now I know this code is probably blasphemy in the eyes of any serious programmer, but I think it's a cool exercise to get 
acquainted with the language so I decided to share it.
Keep in mind, I am but a humble pointer-fearing if-statement afficionado.

Feedback is welcome.

The next step is to write the whole thing all over again but neater and then write a bot to play some chess with me.

06.02.2022 Edit: I am now 100% certain that this is absolute unforgivable blasphemy, but it serves as a testament to how far I've come.
